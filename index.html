        <li>Scant 3 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>

    <h4> Instructions: </h4>
   
    <ol>
        <li>Add the brown sugar to the flour, and mix together until well combined.</li>
        <li>Heat the butter and milk together over medium-low heat, stirring until the milk is very warm and the butter begins to melt. Remove from the heat, and set aside to cool to lukewarm.</li>
        <li>By hand, work the butter and milk into the flour and sugar, kneading until well combined. Continue to knead until the ingredients are thoroughly incorporated and the dough is smooth. Shape into a ball, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Position a rack in the upper third of the oven. Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Grease large baking sheets with vegetable shortening.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into thirds, and roll out on a lightly floured surface to about 1/4 inch thick. Cut into 1-by-3-inch strips, and place 1 to 1 1/2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Bake the cakes for 8 to 9 minutes, or until they are lightly browned on the bottoms. With a spatula, immediately transfer them to wire racks and cool completely.</li>
        <li>Store the cakes for up to 3 days in airtight containers</li>
